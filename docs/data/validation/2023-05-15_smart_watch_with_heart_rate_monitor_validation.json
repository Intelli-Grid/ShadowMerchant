The text is generic and does not contain any unusual phrasing or technical information that would suggest copying from elsewhere. The author name and logo URL are also unique, which reduces the likelihood of plagiarism. However, it's always possible that the content could be copied or adapted from another source, so a low plagiarism risk is assigned."
